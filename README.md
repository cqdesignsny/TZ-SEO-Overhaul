## 🎯 Project Overview

**Client:** TZ Electric Inc.
**Website:** [tzelectricinc.com](https://tzelectricinc.com)
**Platform:** Webflow
**Project Date:** February 12–13, 2026
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete — All changes live

### Core Strategy: The "50/50 Rebalance"

TZ Electric was positioned ~80% as an electrician despite being a **Mitsubishi Diamond Elite Contractor** and offering significant HVAC services. This overhaul rebalanced the entire site to a **50/50 HVAC and electrical split**.

### What Was Completed

1. **SEO Metadata Overhaul** — 30+ pages rewritten, 100+ CMS items optimized
2. **Schema Markup** — 7 JSON-LD scripts deployed (LocalBusiness, HVAC, Electrician, Generator, AggregateRating, FAQ, WebSite)
3. **Image Alt Text** — 95 images updated with descriptive, keyword-rich alt tags
4. **Internal Linking** — 200+ pages connected with strategic cross-links
5. **Front-End Fixes** — Home page updates, CMS bugs resolved, content improvements
6. **UX Improvements** — All accordion sections start collapsed for better user experience

---

## 🚀 Recent Updates

### February 13, 2026 — UI Enhancement
- **Fixed:** All accordion sections now start **closed** when the page loads
- **Why:** Improves user experience by allowing visitors to open sections one-by-one as needed
- **Technical:** Removed `open` class from 4 section-card divs (lines 743, 994, 1112, 1235)
